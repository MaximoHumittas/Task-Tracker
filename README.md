# Task-Tracker

Hi this is my first project for roadmap

They request a guide for this app

add "task" <- for add task
update _id_ "new task" <- for update a task
delete _id_ <- delete for id
list  <- see all the task
list (done,todo,in-progress) <- see by type
mark-in-progress _id_ to change status for "in-progress"
mark-done _id_ to change status fos "done"

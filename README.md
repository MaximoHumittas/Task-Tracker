# Task-Tracker

Hi, this is my first project for the roadmap. (Will be improved in the future)

They requested a guide for this app. Here are the available commands:


    add "task": Add a new task.

    update id "new task": Update a task by its ID.

    delete id: Delete a task by its ID.

    list: View all tasks.

    list (done/todo/in-progress): Filter tasks by their status.

    mark-in-progress id: Change the status of a task to "in-progress".

    mark-done id: Change the status of a task to "done".
